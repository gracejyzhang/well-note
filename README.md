# well-note
A video diary that uses facial expression and text sentiment analysis to allow users and therapists to track emotional/behavioural trends over a period of time.

I implemented speech-to-text and sentiment analysis functionality by using Microsoft Azure Speech Services and Text Analytics. The audio-related data was read, processed, and written to MongoDB Atlas.
